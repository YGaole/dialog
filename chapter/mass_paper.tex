\section{Introduction}
The unique role of $n-p$ residual interaction was widely recognized long ago.~There has been a great interest in interpreting a wide variety of nuclear phenomena, such as configuration mixtures, development of collectivity, spherical-deformed shape transitions and so on, in terms of this force.
